// This is a combination of both the Parser's Task interface and the Flags package's Commander interface.
// Stores input flags for the task, as well as fields representing the data to be collected.
//
// Implementations of this interface should include fields for global and and command-specific options,
// as well as fields for any data that needs to be collected during the execution of the task.
// Implementations should use the `init` function to register themselves via the command registry.
